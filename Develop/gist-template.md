# Title (A Comprehensive Tutorial)
Demystifying Regular Expressions: 
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. This tutorial aims to demystify the world of regex by breaking down its various components and explaining their functions. Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced user seeking a refresher, this tutorial will guide you through essential regex elements with clear explanations and practical examples.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamental components of regular expressions, including anchors, quantifiers, the OR operator, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy matching, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead/look-behind assertions. Each section will provide a detailed explanation of the component's role in regex and showcase code snippets for better understanding.

### Regex Components
My Regex includes all the lists in the table of contents and the details is mentioned as below.

### Anchors
Anchors are used to specify the position in the text where a match should occur. The most common anchors are ^ for the start of a line and $ for the end of a line. 
For example:
regex
^StartsWith
EndsWith$

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or group. Common quantifiers include * (zero or more), + (one or more), and ? (zero or one). Example:
regex
\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}

### OR Operator
The OR operator (|) allows you to match one of several alternatives. For instance:
regex
cat|dog

### Character Classes
Character classes match any one of a set of characters. They are defined using square brackets, 
like:
regex
[aeiou]

### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of the regex engine. Common flags include i for case-insensitive matching and g for global matching. 
Example:
regex
pattern/i

### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses () are used for grouping and capturing. They create a subexpression that can be referenced or repeated. Example:
regex
(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions define a character class. They match any one of the characters inside the brackets. Example:
regex
[A-Za-z]

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Quantifiers are greedy by default, meaning they match as much as possible. Adding ? makes them lazy, matching as little as possible. Example:
regex
<.*>
<.*?>

### Boundaries
Boundaries are used to define where a match should occur. \b represents a word boundary. Example:
regex
\bword\b

### Back-references
Back-references allow you to reuse a matched group. Example:
regex
(\d{2})-\1-\d{4}

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions match a group of characters only if they are followed by or preceded by another group. Example:
regex
(?<=@)\w+
\w+(?=@)

### Conclusion
Understanding regular expressions can greatly enhance your text-processing abilities. By mastering the components discussed in this tutorial, you'll be better equipped to create and interpret regex patterns for various tasks. Remember to experiment with different examples to solidify your understanding. Happy regex matching!
